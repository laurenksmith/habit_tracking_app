# 🧘🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️ Happy Habits Tracker 🧘🧘‍♂️🧘‍♀️

A simple idea for a habit tracking app, built in Python.

Users can log their habits daily, view their progress, and track their habit streaks.
This helped me to practise file I/O, loops, conditionals, and working with dates.

---

## 🧘 Features 🧘

- View all tracked habits and how many times each one has been completed
- Add new habits
- Mark a habit as done for today (can only be done once per habit per day)
- Automatically save progress to a file (`habits.json`)
- Track your 🔥 longest streak of consecutive days for each habit

---

## 🧘‍♀️ How to Run 🧘‍♀️

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/laurenksmith/habit_tracking_app
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd habit_tracking_app
   ```

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python habit_tracker.py
   ```

✅ No extra libraries needed — this project uses only built-in Python modules.

## 🧘‍♂️ Why I Built This 🧘‍♂️

I'm learning Python and wanted to build a simple project I could share with potential employers, showing what I am 
capable of.  
This app also helped me brush up on and practice:
- Functions
- Lists and dictionaries
- Reading and writing JSON files
- Working with dates and times

---

## 🔧 Future Improvements 🔧

- I would like the app to allow users to delete or rename habits
- I would show weekly summaries or goal completion rates
- I would research how to add command-line arguments for advanced users
